The enforcement action stems from a comprehensive investigation revealing multiple instances of material misstatements in the company&#x27;s quarterly and annual financial disclosures between 2020 and 2022.

Specific violations include improper revenue recognition practices, deliberate underreporting of operational expenses, and failure to maintain adequate internal accounting controls as required under Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.

Office of Compliance and Enforcement

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a formal enforcement action against NutriSweet Confectionary Industries, Inc. for multiple violations of federal food safety regulations and unauthorized product distribution in restricted markets. After a comprehensive investigation spanning six months, the agency has determined that NutriSweet engaged in systematic attempts to circumvent sugar content restrictions in international trade, specifically targeting regulatory frameworks in West African markets.

Investigations revealed that NutriSweet deliberately mislabeled product shipments and utilized complex transnational shipping networks to introduce non-compliant sugar-based candy products into regions with strict nutritional guidelines. The company has been found in violation of the International Food Safety Harmonization Act, with specific infractions related to undeclared sugar content and improper import documentation. As a result, the FDA is imposing a monetary penalty of $3.2 million and mandating a comprehensive third-party audit of the company&#x27;s global supply chain and manufacturing processes.

Additionally, NutriSweet Confectionary Industries is required to implement immediate corrective actions, including the complete recall of all potentially non-compliant product batches distributed between January 2022 and March 2023. The company must submit a detailed remediation plan within 30 days and will be subject to enhanced monitoring and quarterly compliance reviews for the next two years. Failure to meet these requirements may result in further regulatory sanctions, including potential suspension of import privileges.]]></description>

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 26395 / September 11, 2025
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Parker Terrill Austin and Embarcadero Capital Advisors, Inc., No. 8:25-cv-02034 (C.D. Cal., filed Sept. 10, 2025)
SEC Charges California Investment Adviser and His Advisory Firm with Fraud and Improper Disclosure of Client Nonpublic Personal Information
On September 10, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged California resident Parker Terrill Austin and the investment advisory firm he established, Embarcadero Capital Advisors, Inc., with fraud related to his efforts to obtain clients for Embarcadero, a firm he planned to launch while employed at a different investment advisory firm.

According to the SEC’s complaint, by spring 2023, Austin harbored ambitions of starting his own investment advisory firm.  To that end, as alleged, Austin sent to his personal email nonpublic personal information belonging to his then-employer’s clients, including names and account balances, and directed clerical employees to send to his personal email client nonpublic personal information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, account values, and fees charged.  On at least one occasion, according to the complaint, Austin forwarded the information to his future business partner at Embarcadero.  The complaint also contends that Austin, while at his former employer, breached his fiduciary duty to a client by placing the client in investments that were contrary to the client’s instructions.  Upon learning of Austin’s misconduct, as alleged, Austin’s former employer terminated Austin.

Shortly after being terminated, Austin launched his advisory firm, Embarcadero, and, as alleged in the complaint, engaged in a scheme to fraudulently induce clients to join Embarcadero, misrepresenting Austin’s disciplinary history and termination at his prior firm on Embarcadero’s website and other publicly available informational brochures Embarcadero filed with the SEC.

The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in the Central District of California, charges Embarcadero and Austin with violations of the antifraud provisions Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint further alleges that Austin aided and abetted Embarcadero’s violation of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Advisers Act and aided and abetted a violation of Rule 10 of Regulation S-P that requires advisers to maintain the privacy of client information.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, including an injunction prohibiting Austin from associating with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jonathan T. Menitove of the Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit and Marc Jones of the Boston Regional Office, under the supervision of Brianna Ripa and Corey Schuster of the Asset Management Unit.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Mr. Jones and Mr. Menitove.]]></description>

The complaint alleges that Austin and Embarcadero Capital Advisors made material misrepresentations to investors about how their funds would be used, the financial condition of the companies, and the risks associated with the investments. Austin allegedly used investor funds for personal expenses including luxury vehicles, real estate, and other personal expenditures rather than for the stated business purposes.

Office of Enforcement

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a $12.5 million civil penalty against TechNova Systems, Inc. for systematic failures in financial reporting and internal control mechanisms. The enforcement action stems from a comprehensive investigation revealing multiple instances of material misstatements in the company&#x27;s quarterly and annual financial disclosures between 2020 and 2022.

Specific violations include improper revenue recognition practices, deliberate underreporting of operating expenses, and failure to maintain adequate internal accounting controls as required under Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. TechNova Systems&#x27; senior financial leadership, including former Chief Financial Officer Marcus Reyes, systematically manipulated financial statements to present a more favorable view of the company&#x27;s financial performance to investors and market analysts.

As part of the settlement, TechNova Systems has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a three-year period and implement comprehensive remedial measures to address identified control weaknesses. The company must also provide quarterly certifications to the SEC detailing its compliance efforts. In addition to the monetary penalty, three senior executives have been permanently barred from serving as officers or directors of publicly traded companies.

The SEC remains committed to protecting investor interests and maintaining the integrity of financial markets by holding corporations accountable for transparent and accurate financial reporting. This enforcement action serves as a clear signal that deliberate financial misconduct will be vigorously investigated and appropriately sanctioned.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[United States Securities and Exchange Commission
Office of Enforcement

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a $12.5 million settlement with NexusTech Innovations, Inc. for multiple violations of disclosure and financial reporting regulations. The enforcement action stems from a comprehensive investigation revealing systematic misrepresentations in the company&#x27;s quarterly and annual financial statements between 2021 and 2022.

Specifically, NexusTech Innovations was found to have materially misstated its research and development expenditures, artificially inflating reported R&amp;D investments by approximately $8.3 million over a 24-month period. The company&#x27;s senior financial executives deliberately manipulated accounting entries to create the appearance of higher technology development spending, which directly impacted investor perceptions of the company&#x27;s technological capabilities and strategic investments.

As part of the settlement, NexusTech Innovations will pay a $12.5 million penalty, which will be deposited into a fair fund for the benefit of affected shareholders. The company has also agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a three-year period and to implement comprehensive internal control improvements. Additionally, the SEC has barred the company&#x27;s former Chief Financial Officer, Michael Reese, from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.

The Commission emphasizes that this enforcement action underscores its commitment to maintaining market transparency and protecting investor interests through rigorous oversight of corporate financial reporting practices. Publicly traded companies are reminded of their fundamental obligation to provide accurate and complete financial disclosures.]]></description>

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 26375 / August 15, 2025
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Wear, et al., No. 25-civ-6713 (S.D.N.Y. filed Aug. 14, 2025)
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chirico, No. 25-civ-6715 (S.D.N.Y. filed Aug. 14, 2025)
Founder and Owner of Washington-Based Water Machine Manufacturer and Two Companies Charged in $275 Million Fraud Scheme
On August 14, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ryan Wear, of Marysville, Washington, and his entities, Water Station Management LLC and Creative Technologies, Inc., for operating two related Ponzi-like schemes between September 2016 and February 2024 that raised more than $275 million from more than 250 investors. In a separate action, the SEC also charged portfolio manager Jordan Chirico, of Carmel, Indiana, for violating his fiduciary duty by investing his private fund client in the scheme despite his undisclosed conflicts of interest and awareness of red flags.

The SEC’s complaint against Wear, Water Station, and Creative Technologies alleges that from September 2016 through September 2023, these defendants raised more than $165 million, primarily from retail investors including veterans, by offering and selling investment contracts in which investors supposedly purchased water machines that would generate revenues. In reality, the complaint alleges, thousands of the water machines did not exist or had already been sold to other investors. The complaint further alleges that in a second, related scheme, these defendants raised more than $110 million from institutional investors between April 2022 and February 2024 through the issuance of Water Station notes purportedly secured by water machines. As with the first scheme, most of the water machines did not exist or were not owned by Water Station, according to the complaint. These defendants also allegedly misappropriated over $60 million of investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors and fund Wear’s other business ventures, including Refreshing USA, LLC and Ideal Property Investments LLC, which are named in the complaint as relief defendants.

The SEC’s separate complaint against Chirico alleges he violated his fiduciary duty to his private fund client, including by directing the fund client to purchase Water Station notes without disclosing his significant personal investment in the business. The complaint also alleges Chirico failed to act in the fund client’s best interests by causing it to substantially increase its investments in the notes despite red flags that some of the purported water machine collateral may have been fabricated.

The SEC’s complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint against Wear and his entities charge all defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1945 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Wear with control person liability for violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by Water Station and Creative Technologies; and the relief defendants with unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties against the defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against the defendants and relief defendants, and an officer and director bar against Wear. The complaint against Chirico charges him with violating Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks injunctive relief, civil penalties, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Wear and Chirico on August 14, 2025.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Heather L. Shaffer, Ming Ming Yang, and Brian Fitzpatrick, all of the Asset Management Unit, as well as David Zetlin-Jones, Jordan Baker, Neal Jacobson, and Patricia Schrage, all of the New York Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Lee A. Greenwood and Mr. Schuster, also of the Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Zetlin-Jones, Ms. Shaffer, and Ms. Yang, and will be supervised by Daniel Loss of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[FDA Approves Labeling Changes that Include a Boxed Warning for Immune Effector Cell-associated Enterocolitis Following Treatment with Ciltacabtagene Autoleucel (CARVYKTI, Janssen Biotech, Inc.)
Medical Product Safety Information
Drug Safety-related Labeling Changes
MedWatch Forms for FDA Safety Reporting
AUDIENCE: Patient, Health Care Professional, Pharmacy, Gastroenterology

ISSUE: The FDA has received reports of immune effector cell-associated enterocolitis (IEC-EC) in patients who received treatment with CARVYKTI. Reports were received from clinical trials and postmarketing adverse event data. Patients with IEC-EC presented with severe or prolonged diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss requiring total parenteral nutrition. IEC-EC occurred weeks to months following CARVYKTI infusion. In addition to supportive care and total parenteral nutritional, treatment with various immunosuppressive therapies including corticosteroids were required. IEC-EC was associated with fatal outcomes from gut perforation and sepsis.

FDA has approved updates to the Clinical Studies section of the prescribing information to include overall survival (OS) data from CARTITUDE-4 trial, a randomized, open-label, multicenter controlled study in adult patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma, who previously received at least 1 prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. With an estimated median follow-up of 33.6 months, a prespecified second interim analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in the CARVYKTI arm compared to the standard therapy arm.

FDA has determined that the overall benefit of CARVYKTI continues to outweigh the potential risks for the approved use, including overall survival benefit in patients treated with CARVYKTI.

Continuous monitoring and assessment of the safety of all biologics, including CARVYKTI, is an FDA priority and we remain committed to informing the public when we learn new information about these products.

BACKGROUND: FDA has completed the review of data from the clinical trial and the postmarketing adverse event reports, and has approved updates to the Boxed Warning (also known as Black Box Warning), Warnings and Precautions, and Adverse Reactions – Postmarketing Experience sections of the prescribing information and Medication Guide to include the risk of IEC-EC.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

Patients and clinical trial participants with IEC-EC should be managed according to the institutional guidelines including referral to gastroenterology and infectious disease specialists.

In patients with treatment refractory IEC-EC, additional work up should be considered to rule out T cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract which has been reported in patients with treatment refractory IEC-EC in the postmarketing setting.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Company Announcement
Eureka Inc of Pomona, CA (10/6/2025) is recalling Durra Ground Cinnamon 100 gram plastic container because it has the potential to be contaminated with lead.

Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Exposure to extremely high amounts of lead may result in overt and possibly severe symptoms for which an individual is likely to seek medical attention. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/body weight.

If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems.

            <description><![CDATA[United States Securities and Exchange Commission
Office of Enforcement

Washington, D.C.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today announced a $12.5 million settlement with TechNova Systems, Inc. for systematic violations of disclosure requirements and internal accounting controls. Following a comprehensive investigation, the SEC found that TechNova deliberately misrepresented financial performance metrics in its quarterly and annual reports between 2020 and 2022, materially misleading investors about the company&#x27;s operational efficiency and revenue projections.

Specifically, the enforcement action revealed that senior executives at TechNova, including former Chief Financial Officer Elena Rodriguez and former Chief Accounting Officer Michael Chen, engaged in a coordinated effort to artificially inflate revenue figures through improper revenue recognition practices. These violations constitute multiple breaches of Securities Exchange Act Section 13(b) and resulted in investors receiving fundamentally inaccurate financial representations.

As part of the settlement, TechNova has agreed to pay $12.5 million in monetary penalties, with $8.3 million allocated to investor restitution and $4.2 million in civil penalties. The company has also committed to implementing enhanced internal compliance protocols and will undergo mandatory third-party audits for the next three years. Rodriguez and Chen have been permanently barred from serving as officers or directors of publicly traded companies and have individually been fined $750,000 and $500,000 respectively.

The SEC remains committed to protecting investor interests and maintaining the integrity of public financial markets through rigorous enforcement of securities regulations. This action serves as a clear warning to corporate leadership about the consequences of intentional financial misrepresentation.]]></description>
