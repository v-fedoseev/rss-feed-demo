The enforcement action stems from a comprehensive investigation revealing multiple instances of material misstatements in the company&#x27;s quarterly and annual financial disclosures between 2020 and 2022.

Specific violations include improper revenue recognition practices, deliberate underreporting of operational expenses, and failure to maintain adequate internal accounting controls as required under Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.

As part of the settlement, Horizon Global Technologies has agreed to a three-year independent compliance monitoring program and must implement comprehensive reforms to its financial reporting processes. The company will also be required to replace its entire financial reporting leadership team and submit quarterly compliance reports to the SEC. The penalty reflects the Commission&#x27;s commitment to maintaining market integrity and protecting investor interests through rigorous enforcement of securities regulations.

Office of Compliance and Enforcement

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a formal enforcement action against NutriSweet Confectionary Industries, Inc. for multiple violations of federal food safety regulations and unauthorized product distribution in restricted markets. After a comprehensive investigation spanning six months, the agency has determined that NutriSweet engaged in systematic attempts to circumvent sugar content restrictions in international trade, specifically targeting regulatory frameworks in West African markets.

Investigations revealed that NutriSweet deliberately mislabeled product shipments and utilized complex transnational shipping networks to introduce non-compliant sugar-based candy products into regions with strict nutritional guidelines. The company has been found in violation of the International Food Safety Harmonization Act, with specific infractions related to undeclared sugar content and improper import documentation. As a result, the FDA is imposing a monetary penalty of $3.2 million and mandating a comprehensive third-party audit of the company&#x27;s global supply chain and manufacturing processes.

Additionally, NutriSweet Confectionary Industries is required to implement immediate corrective actions, including the complete recall of all potentially non-compliant product batches distributed between January 2022 and March 2023.
