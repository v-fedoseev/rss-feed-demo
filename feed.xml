            <description><![CDATA[Company Announcement
Eureka Inc of Pomona, CA (10/6/2025) is recalling Durra Ground Cinnamon 100 gram plastic container because it has the potential to be contaminated with lead.

Short term exposures to very low levels of lead may not elicit any symptoms. It is possible that increased blood lead levels may be the only apparent sign of lead exposure. Exposure to extremely high amounts of lead may result in overt and possibly severe symptoms for which an individual is likely to seek medical attention. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age/body weight.

If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system may occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems.

For adults, acute lead poisoning may cause a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody or decreased urinary output. Chronic lead exposure is associated with kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and neurocognitive effects. Lead can cause serious health problems if too much is ingested, such as damage to the brain and kidneys and can interfere with the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of your body.

The affected product is packaged in Clear Plastic Container, 100G, Durra Brand, Cinnamon, UPC 6251136 034139 and has the affected Lot code: Batch No.: 06 B:02, Best by date: May 2026.

Product was distributed by Eureka Inc and sold at grocery stores in California and Michigan from 08/24/2024 to 10/6/2025.

No illnesses have been reported to date.

The recall was initiated after the FDA collected product samples and detected elevated levels of lead. The firm’s investigation is ongoing, including testing raw materials used in manufacturing the product.

Lead poisoning can be diagnosed through clinical testing, and individuals who have consumed affected product should talk to their health care providers about testing. Consumers who have purchased Brand Durra Brand Cinnamon are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-951-444-7779 from 10am - 5pm PST, 5 days a week, and PST.

This recall is being made with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[United States Securities and Exchange Commission
Washington, D.C.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today announced a civil enforcement action against NexusTech Innovations, Inc. for multiple violations of securities disclosure regulations and financial reporting standards. After a comprehensive investigation spanning 18 months, the SEC has determined that NexusTech systematically misrepresented its financial performance between 2021 and 2022, artificially inflating revenue projections and concealing material weaknesses in internal accounting controls.

The enforcement action results in a $12.5 million monetary penalty against NexusTech, with $8.3 million to be paid directly to the U.S. Treasury and $4.2 million allocated for investor restitution. Additionally, the company&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer, Marcus Reiner, has been permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. The SEC&#x27;s findings revealed that Reiner knowingly authorized the submission of false quarterly reports that overstated the company&#x27;s cloud computing service revenue by approximately 37% during the specified period.

As part of the settlement, NexusTech must engage an independent third-party auditor to review and validate its financial reporting processes for the next three consecutive fiscal years. The company must also implement comprehensive compliance training for all senior financial personnel and establish enhanced internal control mechanisms to prevent future reporting irregularities. The SEC emphasizes that this action demonstrates its ongoing commitment to protecting investor interests and maintaining the integrity of public financial markets.]]></description>

For Immediate Release

2025-111
Washington D.C., Sept. 3, 2025 —

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Daryl F. Heller of Pennsylvania and his companies, Prestige Investment Group, LLC and Paramount Management Group, LLC, with operating a multi-year Ponzi scheme that resulted in investor losses of approximately $400 million.

According to the complaint, from January 2017 through June 2024, Heller and Prestige raised more than $770 million from approximately 2,700 investors, many of whom are retail investors, to invest in ATMs operated by Paramount. The complaint alleges that Heller used his control of Prestige and Paramount to create the false impression that they were running a successful, nationwide ATM network and paying investors fixed monthly distributions from income earned from ATM transaction fees and related charges. In reality, as alleged, the defendants misrepresented the size and profitability of the ATM network and paid distributions to investors primarily using money from new investments and high-interest, short-term loans. Heller also misappropriated more than $185 million of investor funds for his own benefit, including for a beach house and his other businesses, according to the complaint.

“Heller allegedly exploited his connections to his community and deceived retail investors into thinking the ATM investments were safe and reliable, when in reality he used only a fraction of investor funds to buy ATMs and misappropriated $185 million,” said Scott A. Thompson, Associate Director of Enforcement in the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office. “The SEC remains committed to diligently pursuing those who prey on hard-working investors and holding wrongdoers accountable.&quot;

The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charges Heller, Prestige, and Paramount with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. It seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants and a conduct-based injunction and officer and director bar against Heller.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced criminal charges against Heller. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the FBI, and the Internal Revenue Service.]]></description>

What to Do
Boston Scientific recommends that healthcare providers monitor the impedance of defibrillation leads with ePTFE coating because of a risk of tissue ingrowth and calcification. Replacement of leads with impedance over 150 ohms is recommended to avoid defibrillation shock failures.

On July 24, Boston Scientific sent all affected healthcare providers a letter recommending the following actions:
Continue routine follow-up of defibrillation systems with ePTFE leads either via in-person or remote monitoring (RM) per labeling or medical guidelines with consideration that RM can facilitate early detection of this pattern. 
During routine follow-up of affected leads, determine the most recent approximate 28-day average low voltage shock impedance (LVSI) that has not been influenced by the delivery of a shock and review high voltage shock impedance (HVSI) for all shocks from the most recent episode since the last system check using the criteria and data provided in the physician letter. 
The firm recommends programming devices to Initial (RV-) shock polarity and all shocks to maximum energy in single coil leads with a 28-day average LVSI greater than 90 ohms and in dual coil leads with a 28-day average LVSI greater than 70 ohms.
Leads with impedance over 150 ohms should be considered for replacement because impedance over 150 ohms has been associated with as much as a 1 in 10 risk that life-saving defibrillation shocks will fail due to reduced shock energy delivery. If lead replacement is planned, carefully consider the risk/benefit of lead extraction versus abandonment. Based on implant time and likely coil calcification, these leads may pose an increased risk of extraction-related complications.
If lead replacement is planned, carefully consider the risk/benefit of lead extraction versus abandonment. Based on implant time and likely coil calcification, these leads may pose an increased risk of extraction-related complications. 
Be aware of the following to aid in risk mitigation and clinical decision making:
When managing leads with calcified coils, delivery of commanded shocks will not permanently mitigate rising impedance risk, nor will it be predictive of future impedance. LVSI may initially decrease but typically returns to pre-shock values in less than six months. 
While cracking of calcified ePTFE coating has been observed, calcification of the shock coils does not compromise the physical or electrical integrity of the lead.
A trend of gradually rising LVSI correlates with shock coil calcification and is more prevalent with BSC RELIANCE ePTFE defibrillation leads compared to non-ePTFE defibrillation leads from BSC and other manufacturers. Leads may be implanted for eight or more years before this trend appears. 
Reversed (RV+) shock polarity has shown an elevated HVSI compared to Initial (RV-) shock polarity in leads with the encapsulant material. Defibrillation systems programmed to Reversed (RV+) polarity exhibiting a gradual rising LVSI have a lower shock success rate.
There may be circumstances such as routine defibrillator replacement that merit complex decision making. Contact BSC Technical Services for further assistance if necessary. 
Distribute the provided letter to all healthcare professionals (HCPs) within your organization who need to be informed and include this letter in the patient’s medical record.
A patient letter is available, which can be distributed to the patient.
Reason for Alert
Boston Scientific is aware of the association of calcified defibrillation lead coil(s) with a pattern of gradually rising LVSI measurements. This calcification phenomenon can biologically encapsulate and electrically insulate the defibrillation lead coil(s), causing failure to deliver the full, intended shock energy, which may fail to restore normal rhythm during cardiac arrest. 

The most common harm is early lead replacement, and the most serious harm is death or need for cardiac resuscitation.

As of July 24, Boston Scientific has reported 386 serious injuries and 16 patient deaths associated with this issue.

Device Use
Boston Scientific ENDOTAK RELIANCE leads are intended for pacing, rate-sensing, and delivery of cardioversion and defibrillation shocks when used with a compatible pulse generator.
