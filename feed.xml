The enforcement action stems from a comprehensive investigation revealing multiple instances of material misstatements in the company&#x27;s quarterly and annual financial disclosures between 2020 and 2022.

Specific violations include improper revenue recognition practices, deliberate underreporting of operational expenses, and failure to maintain adequate internal accounting controls as required under Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.

As part of the settlement, Horizon Global Technologies has agreed to a three-year independent compliance monitoring program and must implement comprehensive reforms to its financial reporting processes. The company will also be required to replace its entire financial reporting leadership team and submit quarterly compliance reports to the SEC. The penalty reflects the Commission&#x27;s commitment to maintaining market integrity and protecting investor interests through rigorous enforcement of securities regulations.

Office of Compliance and Enforcement

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a formal enforcement action against NutriSweet Confectionary Industries, Inc. for multiple violations of federal food safety regulations and unauthorized product distribution in restricted markets. After a comprehensive investigation spanning six months, the agency has determined that NutriSweet engaged in systematic attempts to circumvent sugar content restrictions in international trade, specifically targeting regulatory frameworks in West African markets.

Investigations revealed that NutriSweet deliberately mislabeled product shipments and utilized complex transnational shipping networks to introduce non-compliant sugar-based candy products into regions with strict nutritional guidelines. The company has been found in violation of the International Food Safety Harmonization Act, with specific infractions related to undeclared sugar content and improper import documentation. As a result, the FDA is imposing a monetary penalty of $3.2 million and mandating a comprehensive third-party audit of the company&#x27;s global supply chain and manufacturing processes.

Additionally, NutriSweet Confectionary Industries is required to implement immediate corrective actions, including the complete recall of all potentially non-compliant product batches distributed between January 2022 and March 2023. The company must submit a detailed remediation plan within 30 days and will be subject to enhanced monitoring and quarterly compliance reviews for the next two years. Failure to meet these requirements may result in further regulatory sanctions, including potential suspension of import privileges.]]></description>

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 26395 / September 11, 2025
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Parker Terrill Austin and Embarcadero Capital Advisors, Inc., No. 8:25-cv-02034 (C.D. Cal., filed Sept. 10, 2025)
SEC Charges California Investment Adviser and His Advisory Firm with Fraud and Improper Disclosure of Client Nonpublic Personal Information
On September 10, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged California resident Parker Terrill Austin and the investment advisory firm he established, Embarcadero Capital Advisors, Inc., with fraud related to his efforts to obtain clients for Embarcadero, a firm he planned to launch while employed at a different investment advisory firm.

According to the SEC’s complaint, by spring 2023, Austin harbored ambitions of starting his own investment advisory firm.  To that end, as alleged, Austin sent to his personal email nonpublic personal information belonging to his then-employer’s clients, including names and account balances, and directed clerical employees to send to his personal email client nonpublic personal information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, account values, and fees charged.  On at least one occasion, according to the complaint, Austin forwarded the information to his future business partner at Embarcadero.  The complaint also contends that Austin, while at his former employer, breached his fiduciary duty to a client by placing the client in investments that were contrary to the client’s instructions.  Upon learning of Austin’s misconduct, as alleged, Austin’s former employer terminated Austin.

Shortly after being terminated, Austin launched his advisory firm, Embarcadero, and, as alleged in the complaint, engaged in a scheme to fraudulently induce clients to join Embarcadero, misrepresenting Austin’s disciplinary history and termination at his prior firm on Embarcadero’s website and other publicly available informational brochures Embarcadero filed with the SEC.

The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in the Central District of California, charges Embarcadero and Austin with violations of the antifraud provisions Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint further alleges that Austin aided and abetted Embarcadero’s violation of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Advisers Act and aided and abetted a violation of Rule 10 of Regulation S-P that requires advisers to maintain the privacy of client information.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, including an injunction prohibiting Austin from associating with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jonathan T. Menitove of the Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit and Marc Jones of the Boston Regional Office, under the supervision of Brianna Ripa and Corey Schuster of the Asset Management Unit.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Mr. Jones and Mr. Menitove.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[United States Securities and Exchange Commission
Office of Enforcement

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a $12.5 million civil penalty against TechNova Systems, Inc. for systematic failures in financial reporting and internal control mechanisms. The enforcement action stems from a comprehensive investigation revealing multiple instances of material misstatements in the company&#x27;s quarterly and annual financial disclosures between 2020 and 2022.

Specific violations include improper revenue recognition practices, deliberate underreporting of operating expenses, and failure to maintain adequate internal accounting controls as required under Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. TechNova Systems&#x27; senior financial leadership, including former Chief Financial Officer Marcus Reyes, systematically manipulated financial statements to present a more favorable view of the company&#x27;s financial performance to investors and market analysts.

As part of the settlement, TechNova Systems has agreed to engage an independent compliance monitor for a three-year period and implement comprehensive remedial measures to address identified control weaknesses. The company must also provide quarterly certifications to the SEC detailing its compliance efforts. In addition to the monetary penalty, three senior executives have been permanently barred from serving as officers or directors of publicly traded companies.

The SEC remains committed to protecting investor interests and maintaining the integrity of financial markets by holding corporations accountable for transparent and accurate financial reporting. This enforcement action serves as a clear signal that deliberate financial misconduct will be vigorously investigated and appropriately sanctioned.]]></description>
